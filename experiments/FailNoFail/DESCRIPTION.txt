Experiment:
	- Analysis:  impact of failures on overall delivery ratio. 
	Process crash ratio = 5%, message loss ratio = 10 %.


Settings:
	- Fanout = 4
	- Node Count = n = 60
	- Msg per Round = 30
	- Num messages = 24000
	- Optimizations enabled
	- View Size = 30
	- Events Size = 30
	- Statistics calculated in the following way:
		Data collected from two different executions of the simulator,
		one with failures, the other without. 
		The system is left stabilize for 100 rounds. 
		The statistics are collected from 100th to 1700th round.
