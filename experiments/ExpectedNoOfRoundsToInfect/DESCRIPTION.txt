Experiment:
	- Analysis: Expected number of rounds necessary to 
	infect 0.99 of the system, given a system of size n

Settings:
	- Fanout = 3
	- Node Count = n = 100 | 200 | 300 | ... | 1000
	- Msg per Round = 1
	- Analized messages = 50
	- NO Optimizations
	- View Size = 30
	- Events Size = 30
	- Statistics calculated in the following way:
		Each round a random process (maybe the same)
		generates a event that is injected in the system. 
		The system is left to stabilize for 100 rounds. 
		Then 50 consecutive messages are taken 
		and statistics are calculated.
