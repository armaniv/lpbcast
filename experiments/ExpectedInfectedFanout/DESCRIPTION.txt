Experiment:
	- Analysis: expected number of infected processes 
	for a given round with different fanout values

Settings:
	- Fanout = 3 | 4 | 5
	- Node Count = 125
	- Msg per Round = 1
	- Num messages = 200
	- Analized messages = 50
	- NO Optimizations
	- View Size = 30
	- Events Size = 30
	- Statistics calculated in the following way:
		Each round a random process (maybe the same)
		generates a event that is injected in the system. 
		The system is left to stabilize for 100 rounds. 
		Then 50 consecutive messages are taken 
		and statistics are calculated.
		Data collected from different executions of the simulator,
		one per fanout values.
