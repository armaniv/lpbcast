Experiment:
	- Analysis: delivery ratio of initial (random purging) and 
	optimized (age-based and frequency-based membership urging) versions of lpbcast.



Settings:
	- Fanout = 4
	- Node Count = n = 60
	- Msg per Round = 30
	- Num messages = 24000
	- Optimizations = yes/no
	- Churn rate = 5%
	- Message loss rate = 10%
	- View Size = 30
	- Events Size = 30
	- Statistics calculated in the following way:
		Data collected from two different executions of the simulator,
		one with the optimizations, the other without. 
		The system is left stabilize for 100 rounds. 
		The statistics are collected from 100th to 1700th round.
