# Lightweight Probabilistic Broadcast

This project implements the lightweight probabilistic broadcast (lpbcast) gossip-based broadcast algorithm. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
 
 [Repast Simphony](https://repast.github.io/requirements.html) 


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
